    {
      question: "Is Artificial Grass Safe for Children and Pets?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Modern artificial grass is specifically designed with family safety in mind. Reputable manufacturers use non-toxic, lead-free materials to create a soft, cushioned surface that's perfect for play. It eliminates the need for harsh pesticides and fertilizers, creating a cleaner, safer environment for both kids and pets to enjoy.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Synthetic Turf Get Hot in the Sun?",
      answer:
        "Like any outdoor surface, synthetic turf can warm up in direct sunlight. However, advanced products now feature heat-reduction technology with specialized fibers and infill that help dissipate heat. For extra comfort on very hot days, a quick rinse with a hose can cool the surface instantly, or you can opt for lighter-colored turf options.",
    },
    {
      question: "How Long Does Artificial Grass Last?",
      answer:
        "High-quality artificial grass is a long-term investment that can last 15 to 25 years with proper care. The durability comes from UV-stabilized fibers that resist fading and a resilient backing that withstands heavy foot traffic. Minimal maintenance ensures it remains lush and green for decades.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can You Install Artificial Grass on Concrete or Rooftops?",
      answer:
        "Yes, artificial grass is incredibly versatile and can be installed over hard surfaces like concrete patios, balconies, and rooftops. This is an excellent way to transform an unused urban space into a vibrant green oasis. A shock-absorbing underlayment is often used to ensure proper drainage and add extra cushioning underfoot.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Artificial Grass an Eco-Friendly Option?",
      answer:
        "Artificial grass offers significant environmental benefits. It conserves massive amounts of water compared to a natural lawn, eliminates carbon emissions from gas-powered mowers, and cuts out the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides that can pollute groundwater. Many modern turf products are also 100% recyclable at the end of their life.",

                1. What Is Artificial Grass? A Look at the Components
              </h2>
              <p>
                Artificial grass is a high-tech surface manufactured from
                durable synthetic fibers engineered to replicate the look and
                feel of a natural lawn. A typical turf system includes several
                key layers: a permeable backing for drainage, grass blades made
                from polyethylene, polypropylene, or nylon, and an infill
                material (like silica sand or rubber granules) to keep the
                blades upright and add stability.

              <p>
                For pet installations, we highly recommend using a zeolite
                infill. This organic mineral is incredibly effective at trapping
                and neutralizing the ammonia from pet urine, which dramatically
                reduces odors and keeps your lawn smelling fresh.

              <blockquote>
                "We installed a 300-square-foot pet turf system in our side yard
                for our two Golden Retrievers. The total project cost, including
                professional installation, was just under $2,000. Six months in,
                there's absolutely no odor, and the turf looks as good as new
                despite daily, heavy use." ‚Äî Mark T., Austin, TX

              <p>
                When buying artificial grass, pay attention to the "face weight"
                and "pile height." For a durable and natural-looking lawn, aim
                for a face weight above 50 oz. per square yard and a pile height
                between 1.25 and 1.75 inches. This combination offers the best
                balance of resilience and realism.
