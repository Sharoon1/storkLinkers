    question: "Q1. How long does artificial grass actually last?",
    answer:
      "A: A high-quality, professionally installed artificial lawn is a long-term investment in your property. You can realistically expect it to last between 15 and 25 years. Key factors influencing its lifespan include the quality of the materials (like UV-inhibitors), the amount of daily foot traffic it endures, and performing simple maintenance like rinsing and brushing. With proper care, your turf will remain vibrant and functional for decades.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q2. Is artificial turf safe for children and pets?",
    answer:
      "A: Absolutely! Reputable artificial grass brands in the USA design their products with family safety as a top priority. Always choose turf that is certified non-toxic and 100% lead-free. Premium modern turf also features a highly efficient perforated backing that allows pet urine and liquids to drain through, preventing the buildup of bacteria and unpleasant odors. This creates a clean, safe, and worry-free surface for everyone to enjoy.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q3. Can I realistically install artificial grass myself (DIY)?",
    answer:
      "A: Yes, a DIY artificial grass installation is an achievable project for homeowners with some hands-on experience. The most critical step is ensuring proper ground preparation. If you're confident in your ability to clear, level, and compact the installation area and apply a sub-base, you can save significantly on labor costs. We highly recommend using a complete installation kit which includes essential tools like a turf cutter, seaming tape, and adhesive for the best possible results.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q4. How do I measure and order the correct amount of turf?",
    answer:
      "A: To ensure you have enough material, start by carefully measuring the length and width of your project area to calculate the total square footage. It's an industry-standard practice to order an additional 10-15% of turf. This extra material provides a crucial buffer for any cutting errors, allows for trimming around complex shapes like trees or garden beds, and ensures all the grass blades can be laid in the same direction for a flawless, uniform finish.",

                      Without proper UV protection, the sun's rays can cause the
                      grass to fade and become brittle over time. High-quality
                      turf has UV inhibitors built into the fibers to guarantee
                      colorfastness for 10+ years.
