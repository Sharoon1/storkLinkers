      question: "Q1: What is the cheapest way to organize a garage?",
      answer:
        "A: The most budget-friendly approach is to start with high-impact, low-cost items. Think strategically: vertical wall hooks for bikes and ladders, a simple pegboard for hand tools, and a reliable freestanding floor rack from Amazon for boxes and bins. You can genuinely transform your space and significantly reduce clutter for well under $100.",
    },
    {
      question: "Q2: Are ceiling racks safe?",
      answer:
        "A: Yes, they are extremely safe when installed correctly. The key is to anchor them directly into the ceiling joists, not just the drywall. Always use a stud finder to locate the joists and strictly follow the manufacturer's weight capacity guidelines. When done right, they are one of the most secure ways to store bulky, long-term items.",
    },
    {
      question: "Q3: Do garage storage racks rust?",
      answer:
        "A: It depends on the material and finish. High-quality steel racks with a powder-coated or galvanized finish are specifically designed to resist rust and corrosion, even in humid or damp garages. Cheaper, uncoated metal racks are much more susceptible, so it's worth investing a little extra for a protective coating for long-term durability.",
    },
    {
      question: "Q4: Can renters use garage storage racks?",
      answer:
        "A: Absolutely! Renters have excellent options. The best choices are freestanding floor racks that require no installation and don't alter the walls. Modular shelving units are also great because you can take them with you when you move. Avoid drilling for wall or ceiling racks unless you have explicit permission from your landlord.",
    },
    {
      question: "Q5: How do I maximize a small garage?",
      answer:
        "A: In a small garage, thinking vertically is the golden rule. Utilize wall-mounted shelves and overhead ceiling racks to get everything off the floor. Combine these with clear, stackable storage bins that are clearly labeled. This strategy frees up precious floor space for your car and makes every item easy to find at a glance.",

            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Let’s be honest—for many of us, the garage has become the
              unofficial home for everything *but* our cars. It’s the final
              resting place for holiday decorations, the ever-growing collection
              of tools, kids' sports gear, and those mystery boxes we promised
              we'd sort out "one day." Before you know it, this valuable space
              has turned into a chaotic junk drawer.

              If you're a budget-conscious homeowner or renter, that feeling of

              find a screwdriver or realizing your toolbox is buried under a
              mountain of boxes is no way to live. The great news? A complete
              garage overhaul doesn't require a hefty budget or a professional
              organizer.

                This is non-negotiable for small garages. Wall-mounted racks are
                your best friend for storing tools, bins, and seasonal items
                without sacrificing floor area.
