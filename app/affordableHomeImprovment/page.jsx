        <h2 className="text-2xl">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to keep your house's value, security, and comfort levels
          high, you need to do home repair work. Having said that, their prices
          may be somewhat high. Finding economical but high-quality services may
          be a challenge for both homeowners and renters, whether it's mending a
          leaking pipe, replacing worn-out roofing, or dealing with bug
          infestations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overspending on services, falling for scams, or hiring contractors who
          don't do excellent work is a big problem. An affordable repair can
          quickly turn into a costly hassle due to hidden fees and surprise
          upsells.

        <ol className=" list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>‚úî Labor-Intensive Work:</strong> Roofing demands specific

          <li>
            <strong>‚úî Material Costs:</strong> Shingles, underlayment, flashing,

          3. How to Find Cost-Effective Roofing Contractors
        </h2>
        <h3>1. Use Roofing Cost Calculators</h3>

          estimate fair pricing based on your roof‚Äôs size and material type.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Get Bids from Multiple Contractors</h3>
        <p>Never settle for the first quote-compare at least three offers.</p>
        <h3>3. Look for Off-Season Discounts</h3>
        <p>
          Winter and early spring may feature cheaper rates due to diminished
          demand.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Ask About Partial Repairs</h3>
        <p>
          Opting to repair only the damaged sections of a roof, instead of a
          full replacement, can substantially cut costs.
