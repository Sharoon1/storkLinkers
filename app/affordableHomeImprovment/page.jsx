            <li>
              ✔ <strong>Mention Competitor Quotes:</strong> When you have
              multiple bids, you can politely ask your preferred company if they
              can match or beat a lower price.
            </li>

            <li>
              ✔ <strong>Ask for Available Discounts:</strong> Many companies
              offer unadvertised discounts for seniors, military personnel, or
              new customers.
            </li>

            <li>
              ✔ <strong>Bundle Your Services:</strong> If you need multiple jobs
              done (e.g., gutter cleaning and a roof inspection), ask if they
              can provide a package deal to reduce the overall cost.

            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Yelp & Google Reviews:</strong> Essential for reading
              candid feedback and seeing photos from actual customers.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Craigslist & Facebook Marketplace:</strong> Can be a
              source for finding independent, local handymen for smaller jobs,
              but requires much more careful vetting on your part.

            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Spring & Summer:</strong> Look for competitive promotions
              on pest control as companies vie for business.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Late Fall:</strong> Many contractors offer discounts
